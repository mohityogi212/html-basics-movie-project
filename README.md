A simple HTML-only project demonstrating the use of **semantic structure**, **headings**, and **void elements**.

##  What I Practiced
- Semantic structure: `<h1>` main title, `<h2>` section title, `<h3>` subtopics, `<p>` for text.
- Accessibility-friendly hierarchy: No skipped heading levels.
- Used `<hr>` as a valid **void element** for section separation.
- Each paragraph adds **meaning and personality** to the page.

##  Why This Project Matters
This project helps beginners understand how to:
- Structure an HTML page properly.
- Write accessible and SEO-friendly markup.
- Use tags meaningfully instead of randomly.

##  How to View
Simply open `index.html` in your browser.
